# Task-03 PASSWORD-GENERATOR :-A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.
   User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
   
   Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.
   
   Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

# Task 3 (Password generator)
Creating a password generator using Python and the Tkinter library for a simple graphical user interface (GUI) is a great project
1. We import the Tkinter library and other necessary modules.
2. We define a function generate_password that generates a random password based on the desired length and populates it in the entry field.
3. We create the main Tkinter window (root) and set its title.
4. We create labels, entry fields, and a button for inputting the password length and generating the password.
5. When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, it calls the generate_password function.
6. The generated password is displayed in the entry field for passwords.
